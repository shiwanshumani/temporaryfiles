# 21. Light
### Find objects in room
For this game, you have a room full of objects and in light sources you have multiple options such as torch, table lamp, candle, and aldo some non light emitting sources such as a glaas, reflective ball etc.
As the object is dragged into the room we need to show the effect of its light, brighter is the source more objects are visible in the room, if it won't emmit light then dark, Further we can ask to classify the light source weather it is a natural or man made by giving some examples.
Then after we can bring some objects to show the refracting and reflecting nature of light as shown below :

# 29. Number spelling
### Spell crush
We can build a game like candy crush where replace all candies with alphabets and flash a number on screen ask the kids swap only those alphabets that are required to build a complete no, in beginner level we can colour the alphabets that are likely to form that no as the level came up unmark those alphabets whereas all other features will remain same as candy crush.
